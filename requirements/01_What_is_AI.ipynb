        "\n",
        "*   **Learning:** Acquiring information and rules for using the information.\n",

        "*   **Perception:** Interpreting sensory input like images, sound, and text.\n",

        "\n",
        "The concept of artificial beings with intelligence dates back to ancient myths, but the scientific field of AI was formally founded in the summer of 1956 at the **Dartmouth Workshop**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key historical phases include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **The Birth (1950s):** The term \"Artificial Intelligence\" was coined. Early enthusiasm led to work on problem-solving and symbolic methods (e.g., Logic Theorist, checkers programs).\n",
        "*   **Early Enthusiasm & Hurdles (1960s-1970s):** Significant progress was made, but limitations in computing power, data, and algorithm complexity led to disappointments and the first \"**AI Winter**\" (reduced funding and interest).\n",
        "*   **The Rise of Expert Systems (1980s):** AI saw a resurgence with \"expert systems,\" programs designed to solve problems within a specific domain based on predefined knowledge rules. This boom eventually led to another period of disillusionment (second AI Winter) as these systems proved brittle and hard to maintain.\n",
        "*   **Machine Learning Emerges (1990s-2000s):** Focus shifted towards machines learning from data rather than being explicitly programmed with rules. Probabilistic reasoning and early machine learning algorithms gained traction. The internet started generating vast amounts of data.\n",
        "*   **Deep Learning and Big Data Era (2010s-Present):** Fueled by massive datasets (\"Big Data\"), powerful computing hardware (especially GPUs), and breakthroughs in neural network architectures (\"Deep Learning\"), AI experienced an unprecedented boom. Major successes in image recognition (ImageNet competition), natural language processing (Transformers, GPT models), and game playing (AlphaGo) marked this era."
